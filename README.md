# Machine-Learning

Algorithms of Machine Learning are implemented using various datasets (From kaggle also).
1. USA Housing - LinearRegression
2. Titanic Dataset - Logistic Regression
3. Classified Data - K Nearest Neighbors
4. <a href = "https://github.com/sameeksharathi/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests%20-%20Kyphosis">Kyphosis</a> - Decision Trees and Random Forests
5. Breast Cancer - Support Vector Machine 
6. MNIST - K Nearest Neighbors
7. ECommerce Customers - Linear Regression
8. make_blobs - K Means Clustering
9. make_blobs - Logistic Regression
